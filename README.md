# Crop-Disease-Prediction-in-Uk-frams-using-Weather-and-Iot-Sensor-Data
This project predicts crop diseases in UK farms using weather and sensor features. All data used is fully synthetic and generated in Python to ensure complete data protection and avoid any use of real farm records. The repository includes preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
Crop diseases can significantly reduce yield and affect food production. By using machine learning models trained on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, soil moisture, and seasonal patterns, this project demonstrates how early prediction can support smart agriculture and better farm management.
The repository includes workflows for:
      1)Data preprocessing
      2)Feature engineering
      3)Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
      4)Model training and comparison
      5)Evaluation and performance reporting
Synthetic Dataset
     1)Created fully in Python using controlled randomisation.
     2)Mimics realistic UK weather and farming conditions.
Includes key features such as:
      1)Temperature
      2)Humidity
      3)Rainfall
      4)Soil pH
      5)Leaf wetness
      6)Soil moisture
      7)NDVI
      8)Crop yield
Using a synthetic dataset ensures:
     1)No privacy risks
     2)No sensitive agricultural data exposure
     3)Fully reproducible experiments
Methods & Models:
The project explores multiple machine learning techniques including:
     1)Logistic Regression
     2)Random Forest
     3)XGBoost
Metrics used:
Accuracy,Precision, Recall, F1-score,Confusion matrix
